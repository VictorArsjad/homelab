# homelab

This repository serves as a central storage for all things related to my personal homelab. It is intended to organize, configure, and document various self-hosted services and tools that power my home infrastructure.

## Current Contents

- **n8n.yaml**: Configuration for the n8n automation service.

## Future Plans

- Add configurations and documentation for additional services (e.g., monitoring, media servers, backup solutions, etc.).
- Maintain scripts and deployment files for easy setup and management.

Feel free to explore, or use these resources for your own homelab setup!
